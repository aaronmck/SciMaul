SciMaul splits transforms input reads into cells, splitting on any number of barcodes located anywhere within the reads. SciMaul handles complex configurations that include indices, UMI sequences, and static barcodes, and produce a directory hierarchy of cells, including statistics about each cell. The goal is to have one tool that can split SCI experiments, 10X single-cell RNA-Seq, and droplet experiments within a single framework.
